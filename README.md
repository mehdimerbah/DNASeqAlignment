# DNASeqAlignment
This is a small DNA Pairwise Sequence Alignment project. It is a tool that reads two DNA sequences from a FASTA file and generates an Alignment Score Matrix 

## Classes Descrpition:
  ### Alignement Class:
  - [x] Create Initialize() Method that initializes the first rows and columns according to gap penalty score.
  - [x] Create getMax() Method to get maximum score when filling the matrix.
  - [x] Create tracePrint() Method to print the score matrix.
    
  ### Alignment MAIN:
  - [x] Create structure for program in Main method.
  - [x] Use FileIO to manage FASTA Files.
  - [x] Uses 2 dummy sequence files for illustration.
